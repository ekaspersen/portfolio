## Education (relevant studies)

-   #### Noroff Oslo, Fagskole - Front End Developer (2 years)
-   ###### More info will be added soon ...
-   ( August 2021 - June 2023 )
-   #### Bodø videregående skole - Påbygg, IT. programfag (1 years)
-   It was a fun year for me because i already knew how to do a lot from the year before, so i used my time to learn extra stuff at the same time as i got to refresh on simple HTML/CSS and other things from the year before. This together with my time watching youtube tutorials and spending time on school projects at home has created a solid ground for my web-developer/designer fundamentals. Sadly i didn't learn about git or github before i started at Noroff so the work i did theese years are lost with the school computers.

-   #### Bodin videregående skole - IKT: Drift og Utvikling (ICT: Maintenance and development) (1 years)
-   Learned about how the internet is connected through a network of computers, servers, switches and routers using protocols such as IP, DNS, http, etc.
-   We also developed more than a handfull of different websites using php/mysql databases and workbench, But first we spent a couple months struggling going about learning HTML and CSS before we implemented php/mysql and later some pages and applications using javaScript. At the same time we had a class about how a lot of stuff works, from how routers route to server operating and some programming fundamentals.
-   I want to give my teacher for that year a special thanks. I think the days would have felt much longer if we had any other teacher than him for some of those subjects.
-   ( August 2019 - June 2020 ) My first year learning code/it.
